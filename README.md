# GameOfLife
Conway's Game of Life
The Game of Life (an example of a cellular automaton) is played on an infinite two-dimensional rectangular grid of cells. Each cell can be either alive or dead. The status of each cell changes each turn of the game (also called a generation) depending on the statuses of that cell's 8 neighbors. Neighbors of a cell are cells that touch that cell, either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal from that cell.

Implementation in Python.
The Grid doesnt have edges. Instead the most right position is directly connected to the most left position. So is the bottom and the top row.
